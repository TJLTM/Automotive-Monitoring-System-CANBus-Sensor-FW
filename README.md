# Custom-OBD-Sensor-Framework

Creating a Basic API and Code Framework for CAN bus sensors. 

While working on the AMS project i realized that i won't be
able to shove all the sensors and associated circuits into 
the space I have alloted. Scope Creep! every time i had to 
make a change it was a nightmare in moving everythign around
to fit everything and then finding something wrong. So a bright
idea was to use a distributed system..... and then that one 
brain cell woke up and CAN BUS.
